## 1. **Understand**

**Start with the data you have.** Identify what insights are hidden within structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. From years of archived emails to operational logs, every dataset holds potential value. Tools like **Python, spaCy, NLTK, and Pandas** lay the groundwork for robust analysis.

## 2. **Visualise**

**Turn data into stories.** Create interactive dashboards, infographics, and predictive charts that highlight key metrics. Platforms like **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau,** and **Power BI** bridge the gap between raw numbers and actionable insights.

## 3. **Execute**

**Insights must lead to action.** Use visualised data to make informed decisions, optimise strategies, and unlock new opportunities. Data visualisation is not the end; it’s the beginning of your business’s next chapter.
