**Inspiring a Million Dreams**

Data, software, and visualisation have the power to reshape lives. My mission is to empower one million youth to harness these tools to their advantage—to build, innovate, and inspire. 

Through my conferences, bootcamps, and courses, I’ve dedicated my career to creating pathways for individuals to unlock their potential and create their own futures.

## The Journey

Every great movement starts with a single step. I founded **The School of Data and Information Visualisation** ([div.school](https://div.school)) as a beacon for young minds ready to explore the vast possibilities of data, software, and marketing. Our programs don’t just teach skills; they ignite curiosity, nurture creativity, and drive change.

## The Tools

From **Python for backend excellence** to mastering **React and frontend frameworks**, our teachings are built around industry-leading technologies. We focus on:

- **Data Analysis:** Turning raw numbers into meaningful insights using tools like **Pandas, spaCy, NLP frameworks**, and machine learning.
- **Visualisation:** Bringing data to life with tools like **Matplotlib, Plotly, Tableau,** and other dynamic visualisation platforms.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Combining backend and frontend expertise to build scalable, impactful solutions.
- **Marketing Mastery:** Leveraging data to craft strategies that engage and convert.

## The Emotions

Data isn’t just about numbers; it’s about stories. It’s the untold truths hidden in transactional data, the sentiment buried in customer feedback, and the opportunities revealed in market trends. I teach students to connect with the **emotions of data**, understanding its human impact and crafting solutions that resonate.

## The Challenges

One of the greatest obstacles businesses face is **technical debt**. Old systems, poorly designed architectures, and short-term fixes often hold back growth. My teachings emphasise the importance of addressing this debt, ensuring long-term scalability and innovation.
