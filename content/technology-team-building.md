# Team as a Service(TaaS): The Four Pillars of Startup Success

A typical startup thrives on a balanced team with clear roles and responsibilities. We provide a 'Team as a Service' model, focusing on four key contributors:

1. **CTO:** Strategic leader aligning tech vision with business goals. <br>
2. **Coder:** Core developer building and testing robust products.<br>
3. **Media Buyer:** Drives user acquisition and market expansion.<br>
4. **Technical:** Supports development for smooth project execution.<br>

# Who Will Benefit The Most From Utilising This Model?

Our Team-as-a-Service (TaaS) model is tailored for startups seeking assistance in turning their ideas into reality. 

We begin by assisting you in sourcing a Chief Technology Officer, a pivotal figure who can collaborate with you in person or remotely to assemble a capable team capable of bringing your idea to fruition.
